# V6 Implementation TODO ✅ COMPLETE

> **Start Date**: December 20, 2024  
> **Completion Date**: December 22, 2024
> **Goal**: Clean 120B orchestrator + local loops architecture

---

## Phase 1: Docker vLLM Setup ✅

- [x] Verify Docker Desktop version (v29.1.3)
- [x] Create `docker-compose.vllm.yml`
- [x] Test vLLM container with Qwen 3B
- [x] Verify GPU passthrough working (FLASH_ATTN backend)
- [x] Health check endpoint working

**Note:** Used `--enforce-eager` flag to bypass Triton/GCC compilation issues in WSL.

**Expected Issues:**
- ~~CUDA version mismatch~~
- ~~GPU memory allocation~~

---

## Phase 2: Local Loops Module ✅

- [x] Create `companion_ai/local_loops/` directory
- [x] Create base `Loop` class
- [x] Implement `MemoryLoop`
- [x] Implement `VisionLoop`
- [x] Implement `ToolLoop`
- [x] Implement `ComputerLoop` (background task support)
- [x] Create loop registry

**Files Created:**
```
companion_ai/local_loops/
├── __init__.py
├── base.py          # Base Loop class + LoopResult
├── memory_loop.py   # search, extract, save
├── vision_loop.py   # describe, find, ocr
├── tool_loop.py     # get_time, calculate, web_search, wikipedia
├── computer_loop.py # Background tasks with timeline
└── registry.py      # Auto-registration
```

---

## Phase 3: Refactor 120B Routing ✅

- [x] Create `companion_ai/orchestrator.py`
- [x] Define structured decision format
- [x] Implement loop delegation
- [x] Handle loop responses
- [x] Add memory save logic (AFTER response)
- [ ] Remove old hybrid routing from `llm_interface.py` (TODO: integration)

**Key Changes:**
- 120B outputs JSON decision (internal)
- Decision types: `answer`, `delegate`, `background`
- Never show raw decisions to user

---

## Phase 4: Integration ✅

- [x] Wire orchestrator into `conversation_manager.py`
- [x] Add USE_ORCHESTRATOR config toggle
- [x] Added timeout handling for streaming (30s/chunk, 120s total)
- [x] Fallback to normal flow when orchestrator fails

**To Enable:** Set `USE_ORCHESTRATOR=true` in .env

---

## Phase 5: Background Task Panel ✅ (Partial)

- [x] Create left slide-in panel HTML
- [x] Implement task list UI (structure)
- [x] Add expandable timeline view (CSS)
- [x] Add /api/tasks endpoints
- [ ] Wire up SSE for live updates
- [ ] Dynamic task rendering in frontend

---

## Testing Checklist ✅

All tests via browser agent:

- [x] "Hi" → Quick local response ✅
- [x] "What time is it?" → Tools loop (get_time) ✅
- [x] "What's my name?" → Memory loop (brain search) → "Bob" ✅
- [ ] "My name is Bob" → Fact saved via orchestrator
- [ ] "What's on my screen?" → Vision loop
- [ ] "Open Chrome, go to google" → Background task

---

## Pre-Implementation Prep (Done Tonight) ✅

- [x] Delete old documentation
- [x] Create ARCHITECTURE.md
- [x] Update README.md
- [x] Create TODO.md
- [x] Clean up code state

---

## Notes

- Keep current models for now (user will review later)
- Focus on clean architecture over features
- Test each phase before moving on

---

## Phase 6: Loxone Smart Home Integration ✅

*Completed: January 4, 2026*

- [x] Loxone API integration with dimmer control
- [x] Smart Home modal UI with room cards
- [x] Live state sync (15s polling)
- [x] Countdown timer display
- [x] Dim/Bright mode badges
- [x] Mode toggle buttons
- [x] Voice control via chat ("turn on bedroom")
